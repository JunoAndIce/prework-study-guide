        <h3>Types of Elements:</h3>
        <br>

        <p>These are the main elements that control the content on a webpage.</p>
        <p>The most commonly used types are:</p>
        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Text Elements</li>
          <li>Image Elements</li>
          <li>Header Elements</li>
          <li>List Elements</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>Alongside these element types there are also element types that control and maintain the page's formatting.</p>
        <br>

          <ul>
            <li>Meta-Related Elements</li>
            <li>Content Division Elements</li>
            <li>Semantic Elements</li>
          </ul>
        <br>

        <p> Two main elements needed for HTML webpage coding are Meta-related and those are the '&#60;head&#62;' and '&#60;body&#62;' elements. </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Head: The '&#60;head&#62;' element contains main information on the wepbage, and includes the title. Information typed in this element is not visable on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Body: The '&#60;body&#62;' element contains the visible content on the wepbage such as images and relevant text. Information that is necessary for the user is typed between this element.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>Within the '&#60;head&#62;' element are also more elements that help give relevant information that is important for the webpage to function. </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>Meta: The '&#60;meta&#62;' element defines the metadata of a document. The meta element is used to detail the character set, page descriptions, viewport, author, and any important keywords of the webpage.</li>
          <li>Title: The '&#60;title&#62;' element defines the title of the webpage. The title element is useful for search engines, and other tools in displaying your webpages name.</li>
          <li>Link: The '&#60;link&#62;' element creates connections to external files. These files could be used for many functions such as CSS and image displaying, and much more.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <br>

        <p>The CSS controls the style and look of a wepbage.</p>
        <p>CSS can be written on the same document as the HTML code, but is generally written on a seperate document, and linked to the HTML code.</p>
        <p>A CSS document can directly interact with elements in the HTML document. For example, you can directly reference all &#60;h1&#62;'s on the HTML document and give them different colors, or text size.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some General CSS notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> You can effect the elements of anything from color, height, width, font-size, margin, and padding.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Color effects the text color for a specific block. Background-color is the color of the element's background.</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Git is a free open source version control system useful for maintaining projects. It offers the ability to rollback to older projects if problems arise in new changes, and allows cooperative work on a codebase without overwriting your peer's work and allows all users to discuss and agree on a new change that can then be pushed into the main project.</p>
        <p>Git is very useful for all codebase projects and almost necessary for organizing work across a large project.</p>
        <p>Git allows you to work on your project locally and keep the original branch intact. Then you can push any changes in a side branch back into the main branch safely.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Git terms:</p>
        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>pwd: Print working directory</li>
          <li>ls: Show folders in current directory</li>
          <li>cd: Change directory</li>
          <li>cd..: Move back one directory</li>
          <li>mkdir: Make a new directory</li>
          <li>touch: create files</li>
          <li>start: Opens target file</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>General Git commands:</p>
        <br>

          <ul>
            <li>git status: checks what current branch we're in.</li>
            <li>git checkout -b: Creates a new branch and changes to it</li>
            <li>git add -A: Add changes to branch</li>
            <li>git commit -m: Commit changes to branch</li>
            <li>git pull origin main: Pull from the main branch</li>
            <li>git push origin: Push to the main branch</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>-A: All changes</li>
            <li>-b: New Branch</li>
            <li>-m: New Message</li>
            <li>main: main branch</li>
            <li>pull: recieve branch's modifications into local branch</li>
            <li>push: add new changes to an existing branch</li>
            <li>origin: Source (Main branch/feature branch)</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <br>
        <p>JavaScript gives interactivity to a website. JavaScript allows clickable buttons, links and much more to function, which give life to a webpage.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Variables can be anything, as JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Javascript variables are not directly associated with specific types.</li>
          <li>JavaScript allows implicit type conversions automatically which means that adding a string to a integer will coerce the int into a string to allow them to be properly used together without throwing errors.</li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Arrays are a useful way of holding multiple different variables inside of just one variable.</p>
        <p>Variables can be delcared in an array form by using brackets [ ], and inputting the relevant information inside the brackets. </p>
        <p>For example: var topics = ['HTML', 'GIT', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'] will store four string variables inside of the topics variable.</p>
        <p>To call a variable in an array, you type the variable name and it's index number in brackets. The index number is the location of the variable in the array.</p>
        <p>Calling 'HTML' will require the user to type, topics[0] where topics is the array where 'HTML' is located in, and 0 is the index. The first slot in an array is always 0.</p>
        <br>

        <p>For-Loops require three parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Starting Point: By delcaring a variable Ex. (var x = 0) The for loop now has a starting point at 0 using x as it's variable.</li>
          <li>The Condition Statement: The condition statement tells the for loop a rule that it will uphold in order to keep the loop going, and as long as that rule remains true, the loop will continue. Ex. (x < topics.length). This information tells us that as long as X is less than the length of the topics array, it will continue to loop.</li>
          <li>The Variable Increment: Finally, you will increment the starting variable. This depends on how your array is handled, but usually you will increment the value by 1 using (x++). Now when the loop completes once, it will go back through but now with +1 added to x.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>This usually contiues until the condition statement is no longer true, which is when the for-loop will stop.</p>
